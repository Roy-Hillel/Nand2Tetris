Hi tester!

To run our JackCompiler do the following:
1. Compile the classes: JackTokenizer.py, CompilationEngine.py, VMWriter.py, SymbolTable.py, JackCompiler.py
2. Run python JackCompiler.py <path/file.jack> (replace <> with the Jack file/dir you want to translate).
3. That's it!
	
For each .jack file in the directory you provided, you will see a .vm corresponding file.

Enjoy!
