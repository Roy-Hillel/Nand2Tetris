Hi tester!

To run our Minesweeper game do the following:
1. Compile the all the classes in the folder from jack to vm (we recommend using the JackCompiler).
2. Run the folder inside a program that reads vm files (we recommend using the VMEmulator).
3. The rules of the game are similar to the real rules and the use of the buttons will be explained inside the game.
4. Enjoy!

Roy and Shaked.
